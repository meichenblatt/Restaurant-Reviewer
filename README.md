## Restaurant Review App

This Restaurant Review App was developed with a focus on accessibility. 

This is my submission for project #3 in the Senior Web Development Nanodegree by Udacity. 

I used AngularJS as the framework and Gulp as the build process.

## Getting Started

In the root directory of the app run:

```
$ npm install
```

For developer mode:

```
$ gulp
```

For production mode:

```
$ gulp serve:dist
```

Enjoy!
